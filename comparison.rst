 Comparison of Properties of Data Licenses
===========================================

See the README.rst file for an overview of the purposes of this document, as
well as links to the text of the licenses described below.

The CDLA FAQ, mentioned below, is available at https://cdla.io/faq.

Where applicable, definitions are included below for some of the defined terms
used in the licenses. In some cases these have been shortened or summarized. In
all cases, the original defined terms (and all original provisions) in the
actual licenses should be consulted for actual use.

In some cases, I have inserted brief additions in square brackets [] to explain
what I believe to be the intended meaning of certain provisions. These additions
do not reflect the literal text itself.
