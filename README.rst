 Data Licenses Comparison
==========================

This repo describes similarities and differences among a variety of common
licenses used for open sharing of data.

"Data" can function quite differently under applicable legal rights -- or the
absence thereof -- as compared to other content, such as software or other
creative works. As a result, common open source software licenses may not be
ideal for the release and sharing of data.

This repo aims to take a look at the terms of some licenses and license
agreements with regards to sharing of data. Some of these licenses were drafted
specifically for use with data. In other cases, they were drafted for use with a
wider array of content, but are commonly used for sharing of data.

Caveat
======

This repo is intended for educational purposes only, and is not intended as
legal advice. If you are considering which license to use for data that you or
your organization will be releasing, you should consult with your own legal
counsel.

The initial contributions to this repo reflect my own personal thoughts on these
licenses. Although I was involved in the drafting of the CDLA licenses, the
details in here should not be viewed as representing those of any other
participants in the CDLA Workgroup.
